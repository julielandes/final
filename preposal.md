# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I'm currently in Senior Design in the College of Engineering, and part of my project involves controlling a peltier heating/cooling unit and a fan through a temperature probe feedback loop with Arduino. However, part of the issue with our project is that the temperature probe does not have the precision needed for it's application, so we want to try to control the water temperature directly with the peltier and use the temperature probe as a correction mechanism rather than as the main driver of the temperature ramp. So fot this project, I want to try to develop a code through Arduino that will create a linear current output for the peltier based on the desired user inputs of starting temperature, final temperature, and ramp speed. I would code it in Arduino, since that is the software we are using for the other aspects of the code. I have not yet gotten this approved by my advisor to use for this project, nor do I know if I will even be able to develop the mathematical model, but that is my first idea.

If that falls through, or if we decide to go a different way with our coding, I will pursue other projects. One idea would be that I could input a song or artist, and the code would build me a playlist based on sings/artist with similar vibes, sounds, etc. I know there's codes out there that already do similar things, but I would try to re-make it myself.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I do not plan to collaborate with anyone at this point in time.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

nope!
