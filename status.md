**I have changed my project from my initial proposal, but I met and cleared it with Professor Rosen**

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have researched the arduino interface, and familiarized myself with some of the differences between Python and Arduino coding. I have ordered the hardware parts that I need to complete the project, and I am still waiting for them to arrive in order to plug them in and test them out. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet researched the notification aspect of my project. I am still unsure how I will be able to send a text notification from the Arduino Interface, but I will continue to research this aspect of the project.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Other than the text message part described above, I have not encountered any issues!
